# 🛡️ Network Security - Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning-based **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** designed to detect malicious network activity and safeguard against cyber threats. It leverages data preprocessing, model training, and automation to identify potential intrusions in real-time or batch environments.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

- 📊 **Network Traffic Classification**: Detects normal vs. malicious patterns using ML models.
- 🧠 **Trained Model Pipeline**: Includes serialized final models for fast inference.
- ⚙️ **Data Schema Validation**: Ensures incoming data follows required structure.
- 📁 **Automated YAML Configs**: Easily generate pipeline configs via `create_yaml.py`.
- ☁️ **Data Pushing Utility**: Automate ingestion using `push_data.py`.
- 🐳 **Docker Support**: Containerized app setup for reproducibility.
- 🌐 **API Ready**: Easily extendable with `app.py` for deploying a REST API.
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation into components like ingestion, transformation, validation, and training.

- 📋 **Custom Exception Handling**: Robust and centralized error management via the exception module.

- 🧾 **Logging Support**: Built-in logging using the logging module for easier debugging and traceability.

⚡ **FastAPI Integration**: Exposes the ML pipeline via REST endpoints using FastAPI for real-time access.

☁️ **Cloud Ready**: Structured for easy cloud deployment.

🧪 **Config-Driven**: All stages use YAML/JSON configurations for flexibility.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- 🧠 Advanced Model Integration: Incorporate deep learning models like RNNs or LSTMs for sequential analysis of network packets.

- 📡 Real-Time Detection: Integrate with tools like scapy, pyshark, or live network tap for real-time packet analysis and threat response.

- 🌍 Full REST API with FastAPI: Expand the existing FastAPI setup to include all pipeline stages (upload data, trigger training, get predictions, etc.).

- 🔐 User Authentication: Secure the API endpoints using OAuth2/JWT for authenticated access.

- 🧪 Unit Testing and CI/CD: Add test coverage using pytest and automate testing with GitHub Actions.

- 📈 Dashboards & Visualization: Create interactive dashboards (with Streamlit or Dash) for traffic insights and model performance.

- ☁️ Cloud Integration: Enable model serving via cloud platforms (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or GCP).

- 🐳 Docker Compose & K8s Support: Extend Docker setup with Docker Compose or Kubernetes for scalable deployment.

- 📝 Enhanced Logging: Integrate log rotation, structured logs (JSON), and centralized logging using tools like ELK Stack.

- 📂 Multiple Dataset Support: Add flexibility to train/test across various public IDS datasets like NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017, etc.
